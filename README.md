# pyMovieDB

**pyMovieDB** is a simple and fun movie catalog written in python. It is *not* the best way you can find to organize your movies information, but is definitly fun to write your own stuff, so here I am.

## Origin
Back in 2014 the UltimateGloriousBinTree project was developed with the goal to implement a system capable of store and manage a huge catalog of movies.
The idea of the project proposed in class was to teach the students how to implement a binary tree and use it with a storage service. The original project 
used C++ as the source language and didn't allow the developers to use any of the already implemented data structures from any library (list, queue).

## Goals
There's **a lot** of gears out there that can be used to deal with huge amount of data like this program is intended to do. The objective of this application is to replicate the old C++ project, 
implementing it's own binary tree class, but it will use data structures like lists in the implementation.
